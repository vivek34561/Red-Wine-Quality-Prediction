# Logging is used to track what your code is doing while it runs—especially useful 
# for debugging, monitoring, and understanding errors.
# It’s a powerful alternative to just using print() statements.

# (exist_ok = True means if the directory already exists, it won't raise an error)
LOG_FILE_PATH  = os.path.join(log_path , LOG_FILE) # log_path is logs folder_name anf LOG_FILE is the name of the log file
